There is only one line of input.

It contains two numbers V (Total number of vehicle) and W (Total number of wheels)

The task is to find how many two-wheelers as well as four-wheelers need to manufacture as per the given data.
Example:
# Sample Input-

130 70

# Explanation-
130+70 = 200 vehicles

(70 * 4)+(130 * 2)= 540 wheels

# Constraints :

W%2=0

V<W
    
Print “INVALID INPUT” , if inputs did not meet the constraints.
